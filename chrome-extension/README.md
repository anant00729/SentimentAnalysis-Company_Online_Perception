## ü™ü Overview
We have developed a Chrome extension that utilizes BERT to analyze the sentiment of headlines from New York Times and Wall Street Journal. By filtering out negative articles, it has the potential to personalize news feeds and create a more efficient news consumption experience. The BERT model processes each article's headline in real-time, predicting whether the article has a positive or negative sentiment. This functionality can enhance user experience, save time, and increase awareness of the overall news sentiment.
